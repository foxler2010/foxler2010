I like computers. I don't like programming computers. I have an account on GitHub because I need to program computers as part of my studies. I will continue to have an account on GitHub even when I don't have any need to program computers, because GitHub gives me free file storage and uses the Git Version Control System, which I am fond of. One day I will have enough hard drives that I can finally move everything off the cloud, touch grass and be happy.
